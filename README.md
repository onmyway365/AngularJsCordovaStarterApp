This is an AngularJs and Cordova Starter App, using Visual Studio with Cordova Tools (and some Ionic)

It has some basic features such as taking an image and displaying it, using the geolocation for current position, 
external browser usage with links, a call to the weather API for a city, and basic navigation.

Running the application:
Install all packages via npm/bower
Plug in your android device and make sure developer mode is set to on
Select Android under the debug options, and select Device as the debug outlet (your phone)
Click on Device to build and launch the app.
